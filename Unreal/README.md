# opensim-viewer Unreal binding

This viewer project, formerly known as the Avination Viewer. It started with Unreal, and we're switching to Xenko.

The Unreal binding has been discontinued, but the code that's here outhg to work. You will need Unreal Engine 4.21 and the Unreal Editor to do much with it.
