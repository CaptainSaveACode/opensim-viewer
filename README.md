# opensim-viewer

This viewer project, formerly known as the Avination Viewer. It started with Unreal, and we're switching to Xenko.
The project is in an early development stage. 

You will need Unreal Engine 4 and the Unreal Editor to do much with the Unreal frontend. And you will need Xenko to do something with the Xenko frontend.
